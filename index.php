      <h3 class="section-title">Work Experience</h3>
      <p>I’m Head of Digital at On The Map Media, where I lead a small team of designers and developers working with nonprofits and startups to power impactful projects to shape their web presence.</p>

      <p>During my time as UX Engineer at <a href="https://www.bluetriton.com/" target="_blank">BlueTriton Brands</a> (soon to be <a href="https://www.primobrands.com/" target="_blank">Primo Brands</a>), I co-managed teams responsible for content development, SEO, UX design, UI design, development and QA to ensure the successful launches of new or redeveloped websites for several brands, providing guidance/direction and hands-on support.</p>

      <p>As Director of Digital Strategy at <a href="https://www.haddadandpartners.com/" target="_blank">Haddad & Partners</a> (acquired by <a href="https://www.purered.co/" target="_blank">PureRed</a> in 2023), I provided technical design, management, and strategy working closely with the CIO, Director of UX, Creative Directors, account/project managers, along with design and development teams from project inception to delivery. Well-versed in UX, UI, and development, I guided in a relatable fashion, fostered collaboration, provided hands-on support, translated needs and ensured proper handoff between teams while mitigating risks along the way.</p>

      <p>Prior to working as a designer in creative agencies, I was Webmaster at <a href="https://www.fsw.edu/" target="_blank">Florida Southwestern State College</a> (previously known as Edison State College) in charge of the web services department leading design, development and strategy for the college’s websites and web/mobile applications.</p>

      <p>Besides achieving unicorn status, the culmination of my experience has made me a well-rounded web architect. I thoughtfully craft websites and applications with user-centered, intuitive, and visually appealing experiences.</p>

      <p>If you’ve made it this far, thanks for your interest. Feel free to take a pass at some of my case studies below and/or review my recent <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resumé</a>.</p>
